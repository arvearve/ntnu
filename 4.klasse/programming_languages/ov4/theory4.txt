Task 1 - Theory
===============

1 a)
----

```oz
declare
fun lazy {MakeOnes} 1 | {MakeOnes} end
A = {MakeOnes}
{Nth A 5 _}
{Browse A}
% A shows up as 1|1|1|1|1|_
```
When `{Nth A 5 _}` is called, the five first five elements of the stream are "required", and get populated. The result of the call to Nth is `1`. We throw this away using `_`, because we are only interested in the side effects of peeking at the fifth element, namely that the five first elements got generated.

1 b)
----
A list is finite, while a stream is potentially infinite (or at least unbounded in length.) The elements of a stream are lazily generated.
A stream is a list whose tail is an unbound dataflow variable. The stream gets extended when the tail gets bound with a `new_value | unbound_data_variable`.

1 c)
----
I do not know how to answer this.
