Project description
===================

Code up and test three different apriori algorithms, and a rule-generation algorithm.


Frequent item set generation
----------------------------

Brute-force method: No pruning until all candidates have been generated. Cross join $F_{k-1}$ with $F_1$.
  
$F_{k-1} \times F_1$: Same as brute force, check for support, and prune infrequent candidates before generating next level.
  
$F_{k-1} \times F_{k-1}$: Cross join $F_{k-1}$ with itself to allow for even more aggressive pruning.


Rule generation
---------------
The key here was recursion. The method to be implemented was handed rule candidates of the form `ABC=>D`, for every combination of `A`,`B`,`C` and `D`.
Our job was to recurse to make sure we calculated the rules of the form `AB=>CD`, and `A=>BCD` as well. This was done by moving the last element of the LHS item set onto the RHS item set before having the method call itself.

The assignment was a bit unclear on how to handle min-confidence. We ran with a hard-coded min-conf set to `0`, and a confidence check determining wether to keep recursing or not. This was done both to keep our results in line with the (presumed) expected results, as well as to show that we were exploiting the anti-monotone property of the arrows position for rules (i.e. we are doing "pruning" here as well). 

We were disappointed that the big data set did not have different results even if you failed to do the recursion properly. Ideally it would be fun if the large data set was designed so that we had more levels in play as well.


Scalability
===========

Brute force: The brute-force algorithm definitely scaled the worst. Every combination of item sets are generated for each level. O(n^2)-complexity regardless of the actual data.
  
$F_{k-1} \times F_1$: Significant improvement in running time over brute force. Allowed us to skip generation of a huge amount of candidates, by virtue of pruning the infrequent item sets before we generated the next set.

$F_{k-1} \times F_{k-1}$: Slight improvement in running time over $F_{k-1} \times F_1$. We suspect the data set did not allow for this algorithm to really run circles around the previous one. Allowed us to skip even some more generation of candidates, by not having to cross join with the original items (some of which turned out to be infrequent when combined with other items.)
