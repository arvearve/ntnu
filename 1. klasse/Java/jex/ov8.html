<h2>Exercise 8: Inheritance</h2>

<h3>Deadline 11. April 2012</h3>

<hr/>

<h3>The objective of this exercise is to:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Understand inheritance.</li>
  <li>Use a class hierarchy in an interactive game with a graphical interface</li>
</ul>

<h3>General requirements:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>You must use inheritance in this exercise.</li>
  <li>Your design must contain the classes shown in the inheritance diagram below.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Recommended reading:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Chapter 9 Inheritance, of Big Java</li>
</ul>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In this exercise, we will focus on inheritance. In Java, classes can inherit fields and methods from other classes.
Through inheritance, you can share common behaviour and reuse code.</p>

<p>The goal of this exercise is to write a simple version of Asteroids with gravity.
A screenshot of a completed game is shown below.
Note that this is just an example on how a completed game may look like, and
that it is completely fine if your solution does not look exactly the same.</p>

<p>Our version of Asteroids supports two kinds of space objects, asteroids and spaceships.
Their behavior will be coded in Java in two classes, <b>Asteroid</b> and <b>Spaceship</b>, respectively.
Since they have some things in common, some of the behavior will be collected in a common superclass called <b>SpaceObject</b>.
Briefly, the concepts <b>SpaceObject</b>, <b>Asteroid</b> and <b>Spaceship</b> have the following behavior.

<ul>
<li>Space objects have a (possibly irregular) shape (outline) defined by a polygon. Hence <b>SpaceObject</b> inherits from <b>GPolygon</b>.</it>
<li>Space objects have a speed (a vector) that may change (i.e. acceleration) due to forces.</li>
<li>The forces are from mutual gravitational pull and from thrusters (spaceships only).</it>
<li>All space objects have a mass, but how it is computed depends on the kind. The mass of a space object should of course affect how forces accelerate it.</it>
<li>Asteroids are solid object with a certain sizes (radius) and density that float around in space.</li>
<li><b>Spaceship</b> also float around in space, but the user can control it by changing its direction and using its thruster for acceleration</li>
</ul>

<p>The figure below illustrates the inheritance hierarchy, and also shows the methods that implement the behavior.</p>

<p>We suggest implementing these classes in the order <b>SpaceObject</b>, <b>Asteroid</b> and <b>Spaceship</b>. To help you test each of them,
we provide three classes that can be used to test each of them:
<ul>
<li><b>AsteroidsStep1</b> creates three <b>SpaceObject</b> instances with specific shapes, locations and speed that make sure they collide.
When they intersect their color will change.</li>
<li><b>AsteroidsStep2</b> creates a lot of small <b>Asteroid</b> instances and one big and dense one corresponding to the sun.
The asteroids should float around and change their direction due to gravitational pull.</li> 
<li><b>AsteroidsStep3</b> builds on Asteroids2 and adds a <b>Spaceship</b> instance that you make control with the arrow keys.
Note that you may have to click in the window to activate the keyboard.</li> 
</ul>
<p>You should study each of these classes and their common superclass <b>Asteroids</b>, to understand how they
use and test the other classes. Below you'll find a more detailed descriptions of <b>SpaceObject</b>, <b>Asteroid</b> and <b>Spaceship</b>.

<h3><b>SpaceObject</b> (50+ points)</h3>

<li>Space objects have a speed (a vector) that may change (i.e. acceleration) due to forces.</li>
<li>The forces are from mutual gravitational pull and from thrusters (spaceships only).</it>
<li>All space objects have a mass, but how it is computed depends on the kind. The mass of a space object should of course affect how forces accelerate it.</it>

<ul>
    <li>The <b>SpaceObject</b> should inherit from <b>GPolygon</b>, and hence may depend on and utilize its methods.</li>
    <li>The speed of a <b>SpaceObject</b> must be encapsulated by the <b>getSpeedX()</b>, <b>getSpeedY()</b> and <b>setSpeed(double, double)</b> methods.
    	In addition, there should be an <b>accelerate(double, double)</b> method for causing a relative change to the speed.</li>
    <li>The <b>getMass()</b> method can return any constant value (use 0, if you want them to be unaffected by gravitational pull).</li>
    <li>The <b>tick()</b> method is continuously called to simulate proper movements. Calling <b>tick()</b> should move the <b>SpaceObject</b> based on its speed (vector).
    <li>The <b>intersects(SpaceObject)</b> method should return true if this <b>SpaceObject</b> intersects the other <b>SpaceObject</b>. We propose two ways of testing this,
    that utilizes the contains method inherited from <b>GPolygon</b>. A simple solution is to test whether the one of the corners of the bounding box
    (as reported by <b>getBounds()</b>) of the other <b>SpaceObject</b> is inside this <b>SpaceObject</b>. A more complex solution (giving 10 extra points) is to test whether one of the corners
    of the other <b>SpaceObject</b>'s Polygon (as reported by <b>getPolygon()</b>) is inside this <b>SpaceObject</b>. In either case, you should think of what happens if
    a very small <b>SpaceObject</b> enters a very big one between two of its corners. The <b>AsteroidsStep1</b> has been carefully designed to test whether you handle this correctly!</li>
    <li>The <b>applyGravitationalForce()</b> method in <b>SpaceObject</b> should use the formula for gravitational pull to accelerate itself.
    Note that it should not move the <b>SpaceObject</b>, since this is the role of <b>tick()</b>!</li>
</ul>

<p>Test with the <b>AsteroidsStep1</b> class. It creates a few space objects that move across the screen. When two objects collide (intersects) they will become red.</p>

<h3><b>Asteroid</b> (25 points)</h3>

<ul>
    <li>The <b>Asteroid</b> class should inherit from <b>SpaceObject</b>.</li>
    <li>It should be possible to set the density, radius and number of corners when creating an <b>Asteroid</b>,
    i.e. <b>new <b>Asteroid</b>(1, 5, 10)</b> should create an asteroid with density=1 and radius=5 having 10 corners.
    Hint: The method <b>addPolarEdge(radius, angle)</b> inherited from <b>GPolygon</b> is useful for adding corners.
    <li>The mass of an asteroid must be computed from its size and density (remember the formula?)</li> 
</ul>

<p>Test with <b>AsteroidsStep2</b>. It creates a lot of smaller asteroids and big one, that should affect each other (and collide).
Note: When the objects get really close to each other they will get enormous speed because of dividing by a small number <code>r</code>. Don't worry about this.</p>

<h3><b>Spaceship</b> (25 points)</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The <b>Spaceship</b> class should inherit from <b>SpaceObject</b>.</li>
    <li>A spaceship has constant mass. Find a value suitable for the simulation.</li>
    <li>A spaceship has a direction (an angle between 0 and 360) that can be set to an absolute value with <b>setDirection(int)</b> and relatively with <b>incrementDirection(int)</b>.</li>
    <li>The <b>thrust()</b> method should accelerate the <b>Spaceship</b> (but not move it).</li> 
</ul>

<p>Test with <b>AsteroidsStep3</b>. It builds on <b>AsteroidsStep2</b> and adds a spaceship that can be controlled with the keyboard. Note that you may have to click in the window to activate the keyboard.
All the features mentioned earlier should work after step 3. Feel free to experiment with your game and try to make it even nicer.</p>
